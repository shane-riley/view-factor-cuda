A CUDA-based implementation of the MT View Factor calculation, featuring multi-GPU compuation using STL's as input

## TODO's

- Implement the STL reading (get number of facets and get next facet)
- Implement the Geometry methods (allocate, free, populate, etc.)
- Draw up the MTCalculator structure (GPU pointers, gpu function wrappers, etc.)
- Implement MTCalculator
- Drive MTCalulator instances in parallel in main
